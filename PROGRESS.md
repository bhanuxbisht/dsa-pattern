# Project Progress & Handover Guide

**Current Date:** November 22, 2025
**Project Name:** SereneCode (DSA Preparation Platform)
**Status:** Phase 1 Complete (Foundation & Design)

## 🚀 Quick Start for New Developers

If you are picking up this project, simply tell Copilot:
> "Read PROGRESS.md and continue from where we left off."

## 🎨 Design Philosophy (Strict)
- **Aesthetic:** "Find Your Calm in the Complexity".
- **Colors:** Deep Charcoal (`#0a0a0a`), Muted Blue (`#3b82f6`), Soft White (`#ededed`).
- **Vibe:** Professional, Serene, Distraction-free. No cartoons.
- **Reference:** See `app/page.tsx` for the implementation of the Hero section.

## 🛠 Technical State

### Completed
- [x] **Project Setup**: Next.js 15, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4.
- [x] **Design System**: Configured in `globals.css` (CSS Variables) and `tailwind.config.ts`.
- [x] **Landing Page**: Implemented with `framer-motion` animations to match the "premium" feel.
- [x] **Hero Visuals**: "Glorious light" effect, glassmorphism cards, and sliding text marquee (FAANG + Finance).
- [x] **Data Structure**: `content/problems.json` created for easy problem management.

### Next Steps (Phase 2: Backend & Auth)
1.  **Database**: Set up Supabase or Neon (PostgreSQL).
2.  **Auth**: Integrate Clerk for user authentication.
3.  **Data Sync**: Write a script to sync `content/problems.json` to the database.

## 📝 Handover Notes
- The **Landing Page** is fully responsive and animated. Do not change the design unless necessary.
- **Problems** are currently static in `content/problems.json`. The next task is to make them dynamic.
- **Git**: The project is initialized locally. You need to create a repo on GitHub and push.

## 💻 Git Commands to Push
```bash
git remote add origin <your-github-repo-url>
git branch -M main
git add .
git commit -m "feat: initial serene landing page with animations"
git push -u origin main
```
